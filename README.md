# TEXTOIR HandBook

## :pushpin: Introduction
**TEXOIR** is the first integrated and visualized platform for text open intent recognition. It is composed of two main modules, open intent detection and open intent discovery, which integrates most of the state-of-the-art algorithms respectively. Moreover, we propose a unified open intent recognition (OIR) framework, which connects the two modules in a pipeline scheme and achieves multiple model combination. This platform also provides a series of convenient visualized tools for data and model management, training and evaluation. It analyzes the OIR performance from different aspects and presents the characteristics of different methods. Finally, it can implement a complete process to identify known intents, discover open intents and recommend labels for intent annotation. It supports benchmark dialogue datasets our proposed unified framework achieves the best results. The demonstration video is available at [there.](https://github.com/XTenLee/TEXTOIR)
